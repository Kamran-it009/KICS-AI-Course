# Rules for Naming Variables
1. Start with a Letter or Underscore: Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). They cannot start with a digit (0-9).

- Valid: myVariable, _my_variable
- Invalid: 1variable, 9name
Follow with Letters, Digits, or Underscores: After the first character, variable names can contain letters, digits, or underscores.

Valid: myVariable1, variable_2
Invalid: my-variable, my variable
Case Sensitivity: Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVariable and myvariable are considered different variables.

No Spaces: Variable names cannot contain spaces. Use underscores to separate words.

Valid: my_variable
Invalid: my variable
Reserved Words: Avoid using Python reserved words or keywords as variable names (e.g., class, for, if, else, True, False, etc.). These words have special meanings in Python and cannot be used as variable names.
